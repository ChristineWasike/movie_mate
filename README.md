## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

## Flutter and Dart versions

You can run flutter doctor to check
```
flutter --version
```

Output should look something close to this:

```
Flutter 2.13.0-0.0.pre.62 • channel master • https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git
Framework • revision 0dfb656e28 (5 weeks ago) • 2022-03-10 12:40:23 -0500
Engine • revision 6b1a24b1a1
Tools • Dart 2.17.0 (build 2.17.0-182.0.dev) • DevTools 2.11.1
```

You can also run flutter doctor for a deeper assessment of your environment:
 ```
 flutter doctor
 ```

 Your output should resemble this:
 ```
